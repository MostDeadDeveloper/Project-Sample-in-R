```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(knitr)
```

```{r load_data}
selected_folder = "1"
directory = paste("output_data/",selected_folder,"/",sep="")
t <- paste(directory,"TIMESERIES-NJUMP.csv",sep="")
njump_data <- read.csv(t) 
pjump_data <- read.csv(paste(directory,"TIMESERIES-PJUMP.csv",sep=""))
ts-data <- read.csv(paste(directory,"ts-data-rows.csv",sep=""))
```

## Automated Report Sample
This is automation at its finest.
```{r  , echo=FALSE}
kable(data,caption = "Data With Outlier Type of NJUMP")
```

```{r   echo=FALSE}
kable(timeseries_pjump_data,caption = "Data With Outlier Type of PJUMP")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
