## Automated Report Sample
This is automation at its finest. I AM here, hello 
```{r  , echo=FALSE,results='asis'}

```

#                 Output Logs
```{r   echo=FALSE}
kable(log_data,caption = "Reported Logs of Each Execution")
```

## Future Automated Plots Is Here

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```
